# Spotify-SIgnUp
A sign up form inspired by Spotify. You can also see your password if you press the eye symbol. If none of the inputs are filled, then it's going to tell you to fill it in.

## The Idea behind this poject ðŸ’¡
Form validation / Sign-Up form, inspired by spotify. If none of the inputs are filled, then the input outline will turn red, if they're filled then it will turn green. There's a button next to the password (an eye symbol), if you press it, it will turn green and  you'll be able to see your password
